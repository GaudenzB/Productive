1. Overall Architecture
Monorepo structure

Clear separation of client/, server/, and shared/, which simplifies type-sharing and coordinated releases.

Consider adding a workspace manager (e.g. Turborepo, Nx or pnpm workspaces) to speed up local installs, enforce consistent versions, and enable cross-package tasks (lint/test/build) with a single command.

Tech choices

React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui on the front end gives you a modern, composable UI stack.

Express + Drizzle ORM on the back end is lightweight and keeps custom logic in your hands.

PostgreSQL is a solid choice for structured data with relations.

API layer

Single Express app currently. You may eventually split API routes into domain-focused routers (e.g. /tasks, /projects, /meetings) to keep concerns isolated.

2. Backend: Code Quality & Patterns
Folder layout

Right now server/ probably contains controllers, models, and migrations together. Consider a feature-based layout:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
server/
  └─ src/
     ├─ tasks/
     │    ├─ task.controller.ts
     │    ├─ task.router.ts
     │    └─ task.service.ts
     ├─ projects/
     ├─ meetings/
     └─ common/
          ├─ db.ts
          └─ error.handler.ts
Dependency Injection / Services

Right now you likely instantiate Drizzle (or get the DB handle) directly in controllers. Introducing a lightweight DI pattern or explicit “service” layer per feature helps with testing and future swaps (e.g. if you migrate to another ORM).

Error handling & validation

Add a centralized error‐handler middleware to catch uncaught exceptions and format API responses uniformly (JSON: { error: { code, message } }).

Validate incoming request bodies with a schema library (e.g. Zod or Joi) before they hit business logic.

Testing

No tests yet? Start with unit tests for critical services (e.g. task creation) using Jest. Then add integration tests against an in-memory or test Postgres database (e.g. via Docker).

Configuration & secrets

Use a .env or Vault for secrets. Introduce a config module that strictly types all environment variables so missing or mis-typed configs blow up early.

3. Frontend: Code Quality & Patterns
Component organization

Group UI into feature folders (e.g. client/src/features/tasks/) with subfolders for components, hooks, and styles. That keeps related files together.

Data fetching & state

TanStack Query is a strong choice. Ensure you have consistent query keys per feature and compose hooks (e.g. useTasks(), useCreateTask()) that encapsulate API endpoints.

Type safety

Leverage your shared TypeScript interfaces everywhere. Consider code generation for your API client (e.g. openapi-typescript or tRPC) to avoid drift between front and back.

UI/UX consistency

You’re using shadcn/ui which is great, but audit for consistent spacing, typography and color usage. A design-token system (e.g. Tailwind config extended with semantic tokens) will help.

Testing

Add React Testing Library tests for key screens (task list, project page). Snapshot tests can catch regressions in your UI.

4. Shared Layer & DX
Shared types

The shared/ folder is a powerful way to keep types DRY. Make sure build scripts catch if you make a breaking change to an interface that the client relies on.

Scripts & linting

Consolidate lint, format, build, and test scripts at the repo root and invoke them across workspaces.

Enforce Prettier and ESLint rules across client and server for consistent code style.

5. Operational Concerns
CI/CD

Set up GitHub Actions (or equivalent) to run lint, tests, and build on every PR.

Automate deployments (e.g. Docker images to AWS/GCP/Heroku) with clear staging vs. production pipelines.

Monitoring & logging

Add structured logging (e.g. Winston or Pino) on the backend.

Expose a /healthz endpoint and configure uptime monitoring.

Scalability & performance

Backend: consider query-caching (Redis) for heavy reads.

Frontend: code-split routes and lazy-load heavy components to improve initial load.
